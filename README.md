# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: Michelle Mann

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Summary

CoExpense is an android app that does calculations on basic domestic bill-sharing. Roommates can enter in their respective costs for the month (i.e. rent, electric, subscription services etc.) and CoExpense will calculate your share of the bills.
Users can enter in a unique number of bill-sharers to each month based on needs. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ‚ÅâÔ∏è üÜò üñ•Ô∏è

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

Wow. This was a stretch across the board. I will say I had some inertia issues on this one and felt VERY unqualified working through the process. I'm happy with the final product and am grateful for the challenge!
